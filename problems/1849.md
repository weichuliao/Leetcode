```python
class Solution:
    def splitString(self, s: str) -> bool:
        def dfs(index, prev):
            # base case
            if index >= len(s):
                return True
            # recursive case
            # go through the remainder of the string
            # remember we have to split the string to at least two seperate values
            for j in range(index, len(s)):
                val = int(s[index:j+1])
                # this val is not the first value that has no restrictions
                # the restriction is as below:
                if val + 1 == prev and dfs(j + 1, val):
                    return True
            return False
        
        # cannot go to the last character
        # because we need at least two seperate numbers
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            # s[:i+1] = a substring from index 0 to index i
            val = int(s[:i+1])
            # examine the next character
            if dfs(i + 1, val): return True
        return False
