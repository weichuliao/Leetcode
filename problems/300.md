## Solution I
binary search

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        sub = []
        for num in nums:
            i = bisect_left(sub, num)
            # If num is greater than any element in sub
            if i == len(sub):
                sub.append(num)
            # Otherwise, replace the first element in sub greater than or equal to num
            else:
                sub[i] = num
        return len(sub)
