## Solution I
binary search and DFS

```python
class Solution:
    def swimInWater(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def possible(t):
            stack = [(0, 0)]
            seen = {(0, 0)}
            while stack:
                r, c = stack.pop()
                if r == c == n - 1: return True
                for cr, cc in ((r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1)):
                    if (0 <= cr < n and 0 <= cc < n
                        and (cr, cc) not in seen and grid[cr][cc] <= t):
                        stack.append((cr, cc))
                        seen.add((cr, cc))
            return False
        
        n = len(grid)
        lo, hi = grid[0][0], n * n
        while lo < hi:
            mid = (lo + hi) // 2
            if not possible(mid):
                lo = mid + 1
            else:
                hi = mid
        return lo
