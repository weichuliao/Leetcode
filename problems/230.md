## Solution I
recursive inorder traversal

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        def inorder(node):
            return inorder(node.left) + [node.val] + inorder(node.right) if node else []
        return inorder(root)[k-1]
```

#### Complexity Analysis:
- Time: $O(N)$ to build a traversal.
- Space: $O(N)$ to keep an inorder traversal.

## Solution II

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        def nodeCount(node):
            if not node: return 0
            l = nodeCount(node.left)
            r = nodeCount(node.right)
            return 1 + l + r
        
        c = nodeCount(root.left)
        if c == k - 1: return root.val
        elif c < k - 1: return self.kthSmallest(root.right, k - c - 1)
        return self.kthSmallest(root.left, k)
```

## Solution III
iterative inorder traversal (using stack)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        n = 0
        stack = []
        cur = root
        
        while cur or stack:
            while cur:
                stack.append(cur)
                cur = cur.left
            cur = stack.pop()
            n += 1
            if n == k:
                return cur.val
            cur = cur.right
```

#### Complexity Analysis:
- Time: $O(H+k)$ where H is a tree height. This complexity is defined by the stack, which contains at least `H + k` elements, since before starting to pop out one has to go down to a leaf.
- Space: $O(H)$ to keep the stack, where H is a tree height.
