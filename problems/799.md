## Solution I
simulation

```python
class Solution:
    def champagneTower(self, poured: int, query_row: int, query_glass: int) -> float:
        A = [[0] * (query_row + 1) for _ in range(query_row + 1)]
        A[0][0] = poured
        for i in range(query_row + 1):
            for j in range(i + 1):
                overflow = (A[i][j] - 1.0) / 2.0
                if overflow > 0 and i < query_row and j <= query_glass:
                    A[i+1][j] += overflow
                    if j + 1 <= query_glass:
                        A[i+1][j+1] += overflow
        return min(1, A[query_row][query_glass])
```

#### Complexity Analysis:
- Time: O(R^2) where R is the number of rows. As this is fixed, we can consider this complexity to be O(1).
- Space: O(R^2), or O(1) by the reasoning above.
