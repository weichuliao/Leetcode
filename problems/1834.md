## Solution I
simulation, heap

```python
class Solution:
    def getOrder(self, tasks: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        tasks = [(task[0], i, task[1]) for i, task in enumerate(tasks)]
        tasks.sort()
        backlog = []
        time = 0
        ans = []
        pos = 0
        for _ in tasks:
            if not backlog:
                time = max(time, tasks[pos][0])
            while pos < len(tasks) and tasks[pos][0] <= time:
                heapq.heappush(backlog, (tasks[pos][2], tasks[pos][1]))
                pos += 1
            d, j = heapq.heappop(backlog)
            time += d
            ans.append(j)
        return ans
```

#### Complexity Analysis:
- Time: O(nlogn)
- Space: O(n)
