## Solution I
recursion with memoization

```python
class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = {}
        
        def dfs(i):
            if i == len(days):
                return 0
            if i in dp:
                return dp[i]
            dp[i] = float('inf')
            for day, cost in zip([1, 7, 30], costs):
                j = i
                while j < len(days) and days[j] < days[i] + day:
                    j += 1
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], cost + dfs(j))
            return dp[i]
        
        return dfs(0)
```

#### Complexity Analysis:
- Time: $O(38 * N)$ where $38 = 1 + 7 + 30$
- Space: $$

## Solution II
dynamic programming

```python
class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = {}
        for i in range(len(days) - 1, -1, -1):
            dp[i] = float('inf')
            for day, cost in zip([1, 7, 30], costs):
                j = i
                while j < len(days) and days[j] < days[i] + day:
                    j += 1
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], cost + dp.get(j, 0))
        return dp[0]
```
