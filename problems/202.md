## Solution I
two pointers, Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        def get_next(num):
            total = 0
            while num > 0:
                num, digit = divmod(num, 10)
                total += digit ** 2
            return total
        slow = n
        fast = get_next(n)
        while fast != 1 and slow != fast:
            slow = get_next(slow)
            fast = get_next(get_next(fast))
        return fast == 1
```
