## Solution I

```python
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Example:
        # numTrees[4] = numTrees[0] * numTrees[3]
        #             = numTrees[1] * numTrees[2]
        #             = numTrees[2] * numTrees[1]
        #             = numTrees[3] * numTrees[0]
        numTree = [1] * (n + 1)
        
        # 0 node = 1 tree
        # 1 node = 1 tree
        for nodes in range(2, n + 1):
            total = 0
            for root in range(1, nodes + 1):
                left = root - 1
                right = nodes - root
                total += numTree[left] * numTree[right]
            numTree[nodes] = total
        return numTree[n]
```
