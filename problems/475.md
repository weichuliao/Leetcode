## Solution I
sort and binary search

```python
class Solution:
    def findRadius(self, houses: List[int], heaters: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        heaters.sort()
        for house in houses:
            j = bisect_right(heaters, house)
            i = j - 1
            right_distance = heaters[j] - house if j < len(heaters) else float('inf')
            left_distance = house - heaters[i] if i >= 0 else float('inf')
            current_distance = min(left_distance, right_distance)
            ans = max(ans, current_distance)
        return ans
```

#### Complexity Analysis:
- Time: O((n+m)logn) where m is the length of `houses` and n is the length of `heaters`
- Space: O(logn) where n is the length of `heaters`
