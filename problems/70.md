## Solution I
bottom-up dynamic programming

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        one, two = 1, 1
        for i in range(n - 1):
            temp = one
            one += two
            two = temp
        return one
```

#### Complexity Analysis:
- Time: $O(N)$
- Space: $O(1)$ for two integer variables needed
