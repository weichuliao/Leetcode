## Solution I
dynamic programming and sliding window, but TLE

```python
class Solution:
    def new21Game(self, n: int, k: int, maxPts: int) -> float:
        dp = [0] * (k + maxPts)
        win_sum = 0
        for i in range(k, k + maxPts):
            if i <= n:
                dp[i] = 1
            win_sum += dp[i]
                
        for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
            dp[i] = win_sum / maxPts
            win_sum += dp[i] - dp[i+maxPts]
        return dp[0]
```

#### Complexity Analysis:
- Time: O(k + w) where w denotes `maxPts`.
- Space: O(k + w)
