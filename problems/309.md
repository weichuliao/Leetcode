## Solution II
dynamic programming

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        if not prices or n <= 1: return 0
        buy, sell = [0 for _ in range(n)], [0 for _ in range(n)]
        buy[0] = -prices[0]
        buy[1] = max(-prices[0], -prices[1])
        sell[0] = 0
        sell[1] = max(0, prices[1] - prices[0])
        for i in range(2, n):
            buy[i] = max(buy[i-1], sell[i-2] - prices[i])
            sell[i] = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1] + prices[i])
        return max(buy[n-1], sell[n-1], 0)
