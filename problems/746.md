## Solution I
dynamic programming

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(cost)
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + cost[i-1], dp[i-2] + cost[i-2])
        return dp[-1]
```

#### Complexity Analysis:
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

## Solution II
dynamic progrgamming (improved space complexity)

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(cost)
        prev = curr = 0
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            nxt = min(curr + cost[i-1], prev + cost[i-2])
            prev, curr = curr, nxt
        return curr
```

#### Complexity Analysis:
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
