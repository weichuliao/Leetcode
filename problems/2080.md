## Solution I
has map and binary search

```python
class RangeFreqQuery:

    def __init__(self, arr: List[int]):
        self.occurence = defaultdict(list)
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            self.occurence[arr[i]].append(i)

    def query(self, left: int, right: int, value: int) -> int:
        pos = self.occurence[value]
        left = bisect_left(pos, left)
        right = bisect_right(pos, right)
        return right - left

# Your RangeFreqQuery object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = RangeFreqQuery(arr)
# param_1 = obj.query(left,right,value)
```

#### Complexity Analysis:
- Time: O(n + qlogn) where n is the length of `arr`; q is the times calling `query`; n is the time initializing a hash map `occruence`; logn is the time complexity of query.
- Space: O(n) for the hash map.
