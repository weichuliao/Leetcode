Solution I: reverse the second part of the list and merge two sorted lists

Complexity Analysis:
- Time: O(N). There are three steps here. To identify the middle node takes O(N) time. To reverse the second part of the list, one needs N/2 operations. The final step, to merge two lists, requires N/2 operations as well. In total, that results in O(N) time complexity.
- Space: O(1), since we do not allocate any additional data structures.
